## Overview

The **Gifford Lab** is dedicated to advancing comparative genomics by creating open resources that promote collaborative research.

Our main focus is the **[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools/wiki/)** framework and **[various projects](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools/wiki/Gifford-Lab-GLUE-Projects)** developed using this framework.

We have also developed the **[DIGS tool](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-tool)** a framework for performing systematic in silico genome screening.

By providing these tools and resources we aim to foster a collaborative environment in virus research.
