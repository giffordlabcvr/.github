## Overview

The **Gifford Lab** conducts scientific investigations into the evolution of viruses and their impact on host species.

We are dedicated to advancing comparative genomics by creating open resources that promote collaborative research. 

Our main focus is the **[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools/wiki/)** software framework and various **[genomics resources](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools/wiki/Gifford-Lab-GLUE-Projects)** developed using this framework.

We have also developed the **[DIGS tool](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-tool)** - a framework for performing systematic in silico genome screening.
