## Overview

The **Gifford Lab** conducts scientific investigations into the evolution of viruses and their impact on host species.

Key themes include:

-   **Long-term evolution of viruses**: Exploring how viruses evolve over extended timescales.
-   **Origins and emergence of viral pathogens**: Investigating the evolutionary history and cross-species transmission events that give rise to new viral pathogens.
-   **Impact of viruses on host species evolution**: Examining how interactions with viruses shapes the evolution of host species.
-   **Paleovirology**: Uncovering the ancient interactions between viruses and hosts through the study of endogenous viral elements (EVEs).

## Software & Resources

We are dedicated to advancing **comparative genomics** by creating **open resources** that promote **collaborative research**. 

Our main focus is the **[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools/wiki/)** software framework and various **[genomics resources](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools/wiki/Gifford-Lab-GLUE-Projects)** developed using this framework.

We have also developed the **[DIGS tool](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-tool)** - a framework for performing systematic in silico genome screening.
