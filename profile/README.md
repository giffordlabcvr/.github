## Overview

The **Gifford Lab** is dedicated to advancing viral genomics by creating open resources that promote collaborative research.

Our main focus is the **[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools)** framework and various projects developed using this framework.

We have also developed the **[DIGS tool](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-tool)** a framework for performing systematic in silico genome screening.

By providing these tools, we aim to provide researchers globally to contribute to and benefit from our work, fostering a collaborative environment in virus research.
